1. bidirectional_nn(BDNN).py -> The implementation of BDNN technique.

2. MLclassifiers.py -> Machine learning approaches of classification(Random forest & SVM)

3. BP_network.py -> General back propagation NN for performance comparison

4. BiLSTM.py -> Bidirectional LSTM for performance comparison

The fold test file and hidden unit selection file is in folder 'testcode'.
Note that the path I used in these files are absolute path name(because my python cannot execute relative path), which cannot be run directly on other computers. Please manually change the path to correct one.

Dependencies:
numpy, pytorch, sklearn, matplotlib, pandas
